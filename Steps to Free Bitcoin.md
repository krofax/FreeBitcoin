# Step 1 - Get a Wallet

    Wallets - I prefer the wallets below but, you can find others at wwww.bitcoin.org/en/choose-your-wallet.
    In order to earn free bitcoin you need to install a bitcoin wallet. A bitcoin wallet is like a normal wallet that holds your bitcoins.
    You can install bitcoin wallets on different platforms; like on a phone or a computer.

  i.  Mobile Wallets
  
    breadwallet - www.breadwallet.com
    breadwallet is free and the most secure bitcoin wallet on apple mobile devices. I personally have used it in the past. It is a 
    very easy to use bitcoin wallet, you can send and recieve bitcoins with a couple of taps.

  ii. Computer Wallets

    Bitcoin Core - www.bitcoinore.org
    The Bitcoin Core is the Basic and Original Bitcoin Wallet. It is made by the people who developed bitcoin. This is my current wallet and it is very easy to use, just like the others.
